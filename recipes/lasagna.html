        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 can (28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups (500g) ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top, overlapping slightly. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering process with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tightly sealed. This will help prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil during baking.</li>
                <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped basil or parsley before serving.</li>
            </ol>
